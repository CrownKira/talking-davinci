## Setting up the code

1. Install Python 3.6 or later.

2. Install the required packages using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up an API key for the OpenAI language model by following the instructions [here](https://beta.openai.com/docs/overview/api-key).

4. Add the API key to your environment as an environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

5. Run the code using the following command:

```
python main.py
```

6. The code will start listening for user input. Speak your input and the code will generate a response using the OpenAI language model.

Note: You may need to install additional packages or dependencies, depending on your system. These instructions are just a general outline of the steps involved in setting up the code.
